Любую секс-игрушку перед первым использованием необходимо помыть и проделывать это после каждого\n                использования. Игрушки с батарейками надо мыть с особой осторожностью, чтобы не допустить попадания воды\n                на контакты. Помимо мытья игрушки необходимо обрабатывать специальными средствами, предназначенными для\n                ухода за ними.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>2. Не стоит хранить секс-игрушки с батарейками внутри, это может стать причиной их порчи.</p>\n\n              <p>3. Практически со всеми секс-игрушками, которые вводятся внутрь тела или контактируют с половыми\n                органами,\n                необходимо использовать смазку. Для деликатных материалов подойдут смазки только на водной основе: они\n                безопасны для любых материалов.</p>\n\n              <h4>Уход за игрушками из силикона</h4>\n\n              <p>Силикон является одним из наиболее популярных материалов в секс-индустрии. С такими игрушками\n                рекомендуется использовать только лубриканты на водной основе. Игрушки из силикона хорошо переносят\n                кипячение. Однако, если игрушка не из чистого силикона, а смеси, от подобных процедур лучше\n                воздержаться.</p>\n\n              <h4>Уход за игрушками из киберкожи</h4>\n\n              <p>Такой материал широко используется для производства мастурбаторов, фаллоимитаторов и вибраторов, так\n                как\n                он очень точно имитирует человеческую кожу. С игрушками из киберкожи нужно обращаться по возможности\n                бережно и аккуратно: так как материал пористый и нежный, он может легко порваться.</p>\n\n              <p> Игрушки из киберкожи нужно вымыть теплой водой с антибактериальным средством. Чтобы быстро\n                нейтрализовать\n                все остатки влаги, можно обсыпать изделие специальной пудрой. После использования рекомендуется\n                обработать\n                игрушку специальным очистительным спреем.</p>\n\n              <h4>Уход за гелевыми игрушками</h4>\n\n              <p>Гель широко распространен, изделия из него мягки, эластичны и неприхотливы. Обычно их выпускают самых\n                невообразимых ярких расцветок. С ними допускается использование любых лубрикантов, в том числе и на\n                силиконовой основе. Мыть их можно обычным мылом с водой.</p>\n\n              <h4>Уход за стеклянными игрушками</h4>\n\n              <p>Для изготовления секс-игрушек используется специальная разновидность стекла: пирексное стекло. Оно\n                обладает высочайшей механической прочностью и его сложно разбить или повредить даже в результате\n                интенсивного механического воздействия. Такие игрушки можно мыть в 10%\n                растворе хозяйственных дезинфицирующих средств, с водой и мылом, кипятить. Для стеклянных стимуляторов\n                можно использовать посудомоечную машину.\n              </p>\n\n              <h4>Уход за игрушками из металла</h4>\n\n              <p>Металлические игрушки служат больше других. Их можно мыть в 10% растворе хозяйственных дезинфицирующих\n                средств, с водой и мылом, кипятить, но не рекомендуется пользоваться посудомоечной машиной, так как\n                химические средства для полоскания могут навредить некоторым видам металла.</p>\n            </div>\n          </el-col>\n        </el-row>\n      </div>\n    </el-dialog>\n
