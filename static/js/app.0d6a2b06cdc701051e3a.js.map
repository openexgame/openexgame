Сделан он из камня, и, как утверждают ученые, иногда применялся еще и для разжигания огня. В\n              Древнем Египте пользовались приборами побогаче: в гробницах фараонов были найдены золотые и серебряные\n              фаллоимитаторы. А в Древнем Китае применяли изделия из бронзы, нефрита и слоновой кости.Ох, нелегкая это\n              работа!\n              <br>\n              В XIX веке диагноз «истерия» был особенно популярен, и чаще всего для его лечения применяли «массаж таза».\n              Судя по всему, занятие это было довольно однообразное: нужно было «массировать таз» до наступления\n              «приступа истерики» (так раньше наименовали оргазм). В фильме «Истерия» режиссера Тани Векслер хорошо\n              показано, насколько утомительным был такой массаж для врача: дело далеко не всегда могло быть увенчано\n              успехом, а руки у врача настолько уставали, что их приходилось окунать в чаши со льдом. Именно как\n              средство борьбы с женской «истерией» и возник первый вибратор. В 1869 году американский врач Джордж Тейлор\n              запатентовал прибор для лечения истерии, который работал на пару.</p>\n          </el-col>\n        </el-row>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n
